Processing project for "Dynamic Crossings" installation (by Realities Group - ECA USP Brazil). It detects blobs from a webcam image and creates tower structures for each of them. These towers change perspective according to day time. Also, the structure of each tower shakes according to a database reading of public remote interactions with this installation (by acessing QR Codes, public can 'disturb' the installation)
